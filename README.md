# Bluesky-Tools

A collection of my JavaScript tools for BlueSky

bsky_comments.js - this is to scrape the replies to a particular post (use the url of the post as a command line argument) and stores it to a Supabase database
starterpack_scrape.js - this scrapes a Starter Pack into a list in your account.  You can use the list to create a custom feed using a custom service like Skyfeed.  This is based on Seth Miller's (@sbm12) bskyStarterPack.php  available at: https://nws-bot.us/
